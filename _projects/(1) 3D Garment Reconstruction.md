# UV-based reconstruction of 3D garments from a single RGB image

Research project done at Human Pose Recovery and Behavior Analysis (HuPBA) group from the Computer Vision Center (CVC) in Barcelona. [Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358120826_UV-based_reconstruction_of_3D_garments_from_a_single_RGB_image) accepted to IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2021) and [Poster](https://sergioescalera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FG2021-UV-map-garment-reconstruction-poster.pdf) awarded with a Google Best Poster Award.

Model based on GANs that has the novelty to use UV maps to represent 3D data and obtains state‑of‑the‑art results on CLOTH3D dataset.
