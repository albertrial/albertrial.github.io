# The Project

Nowadays everyone has a smartphone with an integrated camera.
Therefore, in the events we attend, hundreds of photographs are made, but all of them with different devices.
This makes the task of gathering them all very difficult.
For this reason, in this project I developed an application that allows both the
event organizers and the attendees to upload and gather the photographs that all the
participants take. This service is intended to offer both features of social
networks (comments between users, likes, etc.) and storage services (download
photographs, access them at any time, etc.).

The application follows the Material Design standards provided by Google and it was developed with the Scrum agile methodology.
